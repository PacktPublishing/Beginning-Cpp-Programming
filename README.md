# Beginning C++ Programming
This is the code repository for [Beginning C++ Programming](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/beginning-c-programming?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781787124943), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
C++ has come a long way and is now adopted in several contexts. Its key strengths are its software infrastructure and resource-constrained applications, including desktop applications, servers, and performance-critical applications, not to forget its importance in game programming. Despite its strengths in these areas, beginners usually tend to shy away from learning the language because of its steep learning curve.


## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.

Chapter 10 of the book does not have any code files

The code will look like the following:
```
class point
{
    public:
    int x, y;
};
```

This book covers the C++11 standard, and the associated C++ Standard Library. For the vast majority of this book, any C++11 compliant compiler is suitable. This includes compilers from Intel, IBM, Sun, Apple, and Microsoft, as well as the open source GCC compiler.

This book uses Visual C++ 2017 Community Edition because it is a fully featured compiler and environment, and it is provided as a free download. This is a personal choice of the author, but it should not restrict readers who prefer using other compilers. Some of the sections of the last chapter on Diagnostics and Debugging describe Microsoft-specific features, but these sections are clearly marked.
